## Overview
This project aims to integrate Razorpay, a popular payment gateway, with a Spring Boot application. Razorpay provides a seamless way to accept payments online, making it an ideal choice for e-commerce platforms, SaaS products, and various other applications requiring payment processing capabilities.

## Integration Steps
1. **Sign up and Get Razorpay Credentials**: Obtain your Razorpay Key ID and Secret Key by signing up for a Razorpay account.
2. **Add Razorpay Dependency**: Add the Razorpay Java SDK dependency to your Spring Boot project's build configuration.
3. **Create Configuration for Razorpay Client**: Initialize the Razorpay client with your key and secret in a configuration class.
4. **Implement Payment Flow**: Create controller endpoints to handle payment-related requests such as creating orders and capturing payments.
5. **Handle Webhook Events (Optional)**: Set up webhook endpoints to receive payment-related events asynchronously from Razorpay.
6. **Testing**: Test your integration thoroughly in a sandbox environment provided by Razorpay before deploying to production.
7. **Deployment**: Deploy your Spring Boot application to your production environment once testing is complete.
